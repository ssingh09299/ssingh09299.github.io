We rank students, institutions, teachers, and researchers. I have gone through
different schools, institutes, and I have also interacted with many students.
I conclude: the students, institutes, and teachers have similar abilities. The
higher rank ones push their limits continuously, whereas, others are complacent
with their mediocrity.

Mediocre people are everywhere; with constant efforts, these people can excel
in their fields. One can improve with honesty, industry, and intelligence.  We
need to know our strength and weaknesses, so that we can push our boundaries;
it is only possible with honesty. One can push these boundaries with industry
but applied intelligently. Intelligence works like a machine: a machine gets
corroded when not in use; machine works well when in use. With these tools,
anyone can excel in their fields.


An ideal.
