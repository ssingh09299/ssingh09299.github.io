A society grows with right education that implants the seed of self-awareness,
the seed of fearlessness. Self-aware individuals question, innovate, and set
the society on a path of growth, a path of change. Any growth in the history is
evidence to the importance of a questioning mindset, of people aware of their
surroundings--the educated ones. Ofcourse, literacy is necessary but not
sufficient for being educated.

The society has tremendous possibilities but in deep sleep due to corrupt
humans. Corruption results from the mental boundaries, from the divided mind.
Observe the divisions, the disappointments, we carry with us. With all that, we
behave differently with different people. An improper treatment multiplies; it
pervades despair in the society. The misfortune of a corrupt society is the
self-sustaining nature of corruption; the corruption feeds on itself. A corrupt
society is always stepping towards doom and all societies are corrupt.

The current education system is broken; only privileged ones get it--opposite
to the promises of equality of opportunity. We are in the twenty-first century
and yet the ghosts of past are lingering along; in my country, many educators
deny the education to unfortunate kids on the false premise of untouchability.
We think the world is perfect when everything goes well with us, while ghosts
of past are roaming around in a distant village. The measures like reservation
system doesn't reach to poor, mostly benefits the privileged.

Many talented hard-working individuals have suffered in the name equality. The
greed of policymakers is dividing an already bifurcated society. They were set
to ensure the equality of opportunity, but turned it into equality of
outcome. Instead of providing the good education to all, focus was on equal
representation in the outcomes/jobs. While the policymakers are enjoying the
ignorance of public, we are suffering as a nation because of ineligible
teachers, doctors, engineers, scientists, and so on. Think about it! The
argument is not limited to reservation, it is equally valid for practices of
nepotism, in any form.

The divisions in the society--in the form of nepotism--and measures to prevent
them--in the form of reservation--are harming and further dividing the society.

Postscript: The last paragraphs are only apply to my country, India.
