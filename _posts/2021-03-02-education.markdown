A society grows with right education that implants the seed of self-awareness,
the seed of fearlessness. Self-aware individuals question, innovate, and set
the society on a path of growth, a path of change. Any growth in the history is
evidence to the importance of a questioning mindset, of people aware of their
surroundings. The mind of security stays away from changes, from questioning,
from restlessness; an insecure mind lives in fear and propagates it. An insight
of growth comes from the restlessness of questioning.

The society has tremendous possibilities, in deep sleep due to corrupt human
beings. Corruption results from the mental boundaries, from the divided mind.
Observe the divisions, the disappointments, we carry with us. With all that, we
behave differently with different people. An improper treatment multiplies; it
pervades despair in the society. The misfortune of a corrupt society is the
self-sustaining nature of corruption; the corruption feeds on itself. A corrupt
society is always stepping towards doom and all societies are corrupt.

The current education system is broken; only privileged ones get it--opposite
to the promises of equality of opportunity. We are in the twenty-first century
and yet the ghosts of past are lingering along; many 'appointed' teachers deny
the education to unfortunate kids on the false premise of untouchability. We
think the world is perfect when everything goes well with us, while ghosts of
past are roaming around and gifting the misfortune to innocent children.

Many talented hard-working individuals have suffered in the name equality. The
greed of policymakers is enforcing the division in already divided society.
They set to ensure the equality of opportunity to all, but turned it into
equality of outcome. Instead of providing the good education to all, focus was
on equal representation in the outcomes/jobs. The criteria of selection are
relaxed--is harming the society tremendously, while the policymakers are
enjoying the ignorance of public.

The divisions in the society--in the form of nepotism--and measures to prevent
them--in the form of reservation--are harming and further dividing the society.
