Natural resources are limited. Who own these resources? Are the owners free to
use them in any way what so over? There are the shared natural resources such
as air and water; one may not directly use but there is always some transaction
going on with these. This note questions the nature of transaction with shared
resources.

A physical system, in its lifetime, leaves it footprints in many forms of
pollution. This could be a system used for movement, communication,
ventilation, or living. The people who own these systems enjoys the benefits;
rightly so, they paid the price for it -- their hard (not always though) earned
money. But what about the pollution and wastes? Who does pay for it? ofcourse,
it does not work like a boomerang, and falls on everyone.

The atrocity of poor -- people, societies, and nations -- is that they pay for
something that they did not buy. For example, a tribe living near coastal
region may loose their abode because of the rising sea levels; a rickshaw
driver, in NCR, may suffer from lung problems because of the poor air quality;
the labour class may suffer from side effects of the pandemic brought by those
who fly. The participation of these people in brining the problems is minimal
yet they are the ones who get affected the most.

There is no justice in nature; and human idea of justice is incoherent, and only
exists in Utopia. In any interaction, there is always one party which exploits
and the other gets exploited.
