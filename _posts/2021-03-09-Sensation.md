The sensations are vehicle to thoughts. We interact with the world through
senses: we accumulate, process, and express information through senses.
Thoughts are the compressed processed information.

Senses mirror the world, and often with limitations. These limitations
prevents us from accessing the reality; what we perceive as reality is only
partial.

We think that we live in different places, but all the lives are lived in the
mind. Different places, people are images. We are conditioned to live with
these images, and change of image may cause problems.

In this view, what is the significance of existence?
