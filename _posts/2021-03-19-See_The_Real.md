So many of our problems are pseudo-problem, i.e., they are the result of how we
think. Thinking clearly resolves issues. Messy thinking creates issues; here
are few examples:

* We want happy life but live miserably by chasing it. You can be
  unconditionally happy; conditioning it will result in problems.
* We want to be a scientist but at a certain institute. Is science important or the
  institute?
* We want security and chase it by collecting labels, awards and wealth. All
  this makes us more insecure; we fear loosing it.
* We work to earn money--money to live life in a certain way. But all the time
  goes in earning and when we have sufficient wealth, we do not have the
  health. We could have lived in an optimal way.
* You do not attempt to avoid failure.
