Many of our problems are pseudo-problems, i.e., they are the result of how we
think. Thinking clearly resolves issues. Messy thinking creates issues; here
are a few examples of messy thinking;

* We want happy life but live miserably by chasing happiness. You can be
  unconditionally happy; conditioning it will result in problems.

* We want to be in a certain profession but condition it through various
  conditions and criteria. One might say that we want to satisfy one of those
  criteria and there is no love for that profession.

* We want security and chase it by collecting labels, awards, and wealth. All
  this makes us more insecure; we fear losing them.

* We work to earn money--money to live life in a certain way--but all the time
  goes in earning.

* We do not attempt, just to avoid failure; yet without attempting, we fail.

* We strive for excellence--by imitating others--and end up being a copycat.

* We chase power through labels and when labels are removed we feel helpless.

I wish, I knew, what I am talking about.
