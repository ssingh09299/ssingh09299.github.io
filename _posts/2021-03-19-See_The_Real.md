I have interacted with many researchers ('labeled so'), and came to conclusion
that most of these people worry more about their affiliation than their
knowledge, their research. I have borrowed this attitude from them. I am
worrying about where I would teach and if I go into an institution not equipped
with enough facilities, I might not be able to do the research up to my
potential (it is a different matter that I might end up doing nothing even if
I get a good lab). I'm sure my teaching would not be affected but research part
seems to be highly dependent on the availability of the facilities. But then
again, most of the research that is carried out is forceful and highly based on
increasing the number of publications.

We tend to judge the value of a research by its complexity and not by its
impact. Impact in the sense of real world not on the basis of how many people
will cite it. There are so many self complete cycle of jobs which does not
serve real purposes such as marketing jobs, some of the research, teaching of
some obsolete subjects. An argument can be made that we never know that it may
become useful in future.
