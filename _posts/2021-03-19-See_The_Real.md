So many of our problems are pseudo-problems, i.e., they are the result of how we
think. Thinking clearly resolves issues. Messy thinking creates issues; here
are a few examples of messy thinking;

* We want happy life but live miserably by chasing happiness. You can be
  unconditionally happy; conditioning it will result in problems.

* We want to be a scientist but at a certain institute. We want to play cricket
  but only for the national team. We want to study technology but only at IIT or
  MIT. Is science important or the institute? Is the work important or the
  labels? If you love your work, nothing else should be important. Just ensure
  that you are not enslaved by the system to do their things.

* We want security and chase it by collecting labels, awards, and wealth. All
  this makes us more insecure; we fear losing them.

* We work to earn money--money to live life in a certain way. But all the time
  goes in earning and when we have sufficient wealth, we do not have the
  health to live the way we want to.

* We do not attempt, just to avoid failure; yet without attempting, we fail.
