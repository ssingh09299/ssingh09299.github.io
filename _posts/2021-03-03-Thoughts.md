<!--Introduction of thoughts-->
Thinking brings the idea of being to humans. The thought, a perturbation in the
consciousness, creates and also destroys. Thoughts are the memories, the ideas,
and also the running commentaries of mind. The thought gives you importance and
also takes it back. While we are transient, the thought stays and propagates
into the future.

What would be life without ability to think?
