What is the role of thoughts in our lives? We act the thoughts; we learn to
channelize them in a certain way -- through family, friends, society, and
teachers.  Each profession requires you to think in a certain way -- we train
ourselves to reach there. A politician and a teacher process the information in
different ways; the thoughts make distinct individuals.

Everything around us is a thought in action, think about it. We are also
thoughts in actions but of course, people are much more than that.  In my early
education, I used to be afraid of teachers and people with significant
knowledge; no one likes to be told that they are wrong. I started seeing them
as a person undergone rigorous training; I realized that they were once
students and full of doubts and questions, my fear disappeared. See how thinking
differently changes the whole dynamics.

The quality of our lives is dependent on the quality of our thoughts. A good
way of thinking helps in tough times, and a bad way of thinking obstructs
good times. We can think differently in a similar situation; what we choose,
decides our quality of life. One can see a failed person or a great amount
of learning in a failed endeavor.

There is a thought, and there is a vast memory or experience behind that. Is
the constitution of thought different from the constitution of the memory? We
select the memory and reminisce it; the reminiscence is also a thought.

Observe your thoughts, witness what's going on in there. Train yourself to
think clearly.
