<!--Introduction of thoughts-->
Thinking brings the idea of being to humans. Imagine how life would be without
ability to think.

The thought, a perturbation in the consciousness, creates and also destroys.
Whatever is human made is the result of thought, or it is a thought. All the
creation by humans is a thought.

The thought gives you importance and also takes it back. While we are
transient, the thought stays and propagates into the future.

What would be life without ability to think?
