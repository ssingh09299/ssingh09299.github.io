Failure, a sense of failed endeavor, is closest to my heart among all the
topics related to human conditioning.

**Desire to be superior**:

There is an innate desire in us to be superior (not really the best) to
everyone else. We enjoy belittling others work or even existence. It gives
us a sense of pleasure. In a gathering of individuals, there is always unspoken
consensus on the superiority index, if not then there is a constant struggle
between those individuals. In the current world, there is also a dimensionality
aspect attached to the superiority. Two superior individuals may also not be
conflicted because they have acclaimed this status in different dimensions.
