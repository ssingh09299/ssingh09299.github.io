A lady's husband was a souse yet she had never tasted alcohol in her life.

Here you souse! Give me that bottle, she said, I want to taste whatever it is
that has made you the bum you are. Taking the bottle of whisky; she took
a good gulp of it.

Akkh! bleach! she gasped. That's the most wild tasting
liquid I have ever had; the misfortune to let that pass my lips, it is
terrible.

**You see, said the old man, and all these years you thought I was having
a good time.**
