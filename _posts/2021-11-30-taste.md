A lady's husband was a souse yet she had never tasted alcohol in her life. Here
you souse! Give me that bottle; I want to taste whatever it is that has made
you the bum you are. Taking the bottle of cheap whisky; she took a good gulp of
it. Akkh! bleach! she gasped. That's the most wild tasting liquid I have ever
had; the misfortune to let that pass my lips, it is terrible.

You see, said the old man, and all these years you thought I was having a good time.
