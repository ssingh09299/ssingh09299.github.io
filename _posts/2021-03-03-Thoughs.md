<!--Introduction of thoughts-->
Thinking imports being to human life: the idea of being. The form of thinking
is the thought--a perturbation in the consciousness. Thought, the perturbation,
breeds creativity, dullness, and destruction. Thoughts manifest into
beauty--also a thought. Thoughts create objects, and objects influences the
thoughts: all, that is, is the thought.

Life moves with the thoughts; the time moves with the thoughts. The body
interacts with the thought; the body hosts the thoughts, influences the
thoughts, and, also, reacts to thoughts--a marvelous cycle.

Thoughts are the memories, the ideas, and the commentaries of minds--the
residuals.
