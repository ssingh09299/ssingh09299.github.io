The objective this blog is to write about the my experiences--on the person
front--and academic interests.

On the academic front, I will attempt to cover the origins of different topics
in soil mechanics, basically a review of history. For now, I intend to cover:

- Critical state soil mechanics
- Unsaturated soil mechanics
- Particulate soil mechanics

## About me
My name is Saurabh. I work on the sand behavior--elemental experiments, image
analysis, and constitutive modeling.
